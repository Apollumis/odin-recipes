        <h3>Dads Spaghetti</h2>
        <p>This recipe is incredibly simple and should take no more than 25 minutes to make. <strong>Dads Spaghetti</strong> is an obvious poke at spaghetti made by dads. Not only is it simple and mostly bland, but you are supposed to slightly overcook the noodles before serving them. This is a funny dish and incredibly easy if you're looking to have a little fun.</p>
